Implement SceneManager class which creates each scene and calls each method in order (!)

	Contains a list of all active scenes, iterating over all of them on every update (!)

	Controls which scene to switch to after the current one is over (!)

Move basically all functionality from Kernel to new LevelScene class (!)

	Move everything that initializes the level itself into new LevelScene3 class, to allow for multiple levels (!)

Implement MenuScene class which houses the main menu (!)

	Contains multiple options (!)

		Start game (!)

		Key configuration, allowing the player to change the keys for a specific action (this will require a global InputManager that's passed to each scene, instead of them creating their own)

		Exit (!)

	Controllable with mouse (!) & keyboard

Implement LevelScene1 & 2 based on the design document (!)

Remove all references to kernel where unnecessary, use events instead

Implement interfaces for every reference in the program

Improve inheritance & code reusability
